Muck around project using Django and associated tech

## My Money
My Money is a saas website that provides analytics on a persons spending. 
A user will upload their bank statement and there will be a dashboard that will display
a range of information. 

Atm the only info displayed will be a calendar that shows a user's spending on a 
daily, weekly, monthly view. 

Hopefully an intelligent search bar can be added later.


## Tech:
- python 3.9 
- django 3.1.4
- django rest framework  
- docker
- travis ci
- postgres
- celery
- rabbit qm
